In fact, I was always on the road.

I can't say I have got the things I need, but I still know just one thing:

I will always go on.

When I was on my Road, I have got much help from others, and They have shared their courage with me.
That's must be the best treasure.

I won't lost the key, if you find the door to me.

All the best, my dear friends.
